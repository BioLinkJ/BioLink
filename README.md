# BioLink
A research tool for acquiring physiological data (ECG, EDA, etc.) during experiments.

BioLink is a data acquisition tool that is intended to close the gap between your experiment procedure (in Presentation Â® or PsychoPy) and the recorded physiological data. This is done by synchronizing both data sources on one timeline; i.e. recording timestamps from events in the experiment procedure with the physiological data.
To date, it is supporting the biosignalsplux research kit devices (see http://biosignalsplux.com) for data acquisition.
The raw data is stored as it is received from the acquisition device and can be analysed using any tool supporting import of .csv files.

BioLink is a pure Python application, provicing an easy to use graphical user interface (GTK+ based).
For compatibility with PsychoPy, it is built using Python 2.7 32-Bit edition.
